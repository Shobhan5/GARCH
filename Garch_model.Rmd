#As we can see, the histogram of the of the returns seems to be more skewed than the normal distribution, meaning that considering the normal distribution for the returns is not a good choice. The student distribution  tends to be the more adapted for this distribution. We will see if that is confirmed by the model estimation. 
#The next step is to calculate the annualized volatility and the rolling-window volatility of returns. This can be done either at the daily, monthly, quarterly frequency, etc. Here is the code for the monthly. width = 22 (252 for yearly frequency)
